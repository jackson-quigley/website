		Intro	
	</h3>
	<p>
This is the personal site of, surpisingly enough, Jackson Quigley.
	</p>
	<p>
I suppose this will be where I keep up-to-date information on my never finished essays and projects for the viewing displeasure of the world.

	<h3>
		About
	</h3>
	<p>
Presently a member of the university botnet, Jackson Quigley is an undergraduate studying presumably electrical engineering at North Carolina State University.
	</p>
	<p>
Aside from electrical engineering Jackson dabbles in free software (link) and like all edgy teens/college students political theory(link) and philosophy(link).
	</p>
	<p>
Peep my uninteresting resume here for more information.
